# Problem Statement:
![question](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x41head/CTF-Writeups/main/src/DOA2021ctf/Misc/Degrees/ques.png)

## Solution:

Going into this question I had no idea what degree between two people meant.

So I searched it on google and came across [this blogpost](https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2015/10/15/six-degrees-of-separation-amongst-actors/) published by Cornell University. At the bottom it links me to [https://oracleofbacon.org/](https://oracleofbacon.org/) where I can check the degree between two actors.

I typed Bruce Lee and Woody Allen as my parameters and get the degree between them.

I change the output as told in the question to retrive the flag i.e.
`DO{2_Jackie_Chan_Final_Cut}`
