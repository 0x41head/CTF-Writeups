# Problem Statement:
![question](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x41head/CTF-Writeups/main/src/DOA2021ctf/OSINT/One%20of%20the%20classics/ques.png)

## Solution:
This challenge came along with the .jpg image below :

![quest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x41head/CTF-Writeups/main/src/DOA2021ctf/OSINT/One%20of%20the%20classics/c4.jpg)

Reverse searching this image brought me to [this blogpost](https://fightersgeneration.com/news1/capcom-store-tokyo2.htm) which told me that the picture was from Capcom Store Tokyo.

I tried using that as my flag but to no avail. So, I took a bit of inspiration from [A childhood favourite](https://0x41head.github.io/CTF-Writeups/book/DOA2021ctf/OSINT/A%20childhood%20favourite/A%20childhood%20favourite.html) and searched for the location of this store.

While doing this one of my attempts `DO{Shibuya_Parco}`, was accepted.
