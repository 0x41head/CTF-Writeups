Reverse searching this image brought brougt me to the wikipedia page of [Bunbuku Chagama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunbuku_Chagama), a folklore involving a teapot racoon.

I tried a bunch of different variations of Bunbuku Chagama to no avail before taking a step backwards and realizing that the challenge was asking me to name the creature.

I then tried tanuki as my flag text and it was accepted.
