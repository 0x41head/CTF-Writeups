# Problem Statement:
![question](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x41head/CTF-Writeups/main/src/DOA2021ctf/OSINT/The%20land%20of%20culture/ques.png)

## Solution:
This challenge came along with the .jpg image below :

![quest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x41head/CTF-Writeups/main/src/DOA2021ctf/OSINT/The%20land%20of%20culture/c2.jfif)

Looking at this image I recognized it immediately as Akihabra (I knew being a weeb would help me someday)

But that wasn't the flag (At the time of me solving this there was no hints telling me that it was 3 words long )

I then jumped to google maps to get a more precise location of where the picture was taken.

So with the help of the SEGA building and google maps I was able to recreate more or less the same image as given in the challenge.

Moving the camera around 180 degrees we can see where this picture was taken from.

The flag was retrieved.
