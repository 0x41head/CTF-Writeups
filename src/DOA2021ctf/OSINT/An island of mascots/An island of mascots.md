![chall](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x41head/CTF-Writeups/main/src/DOA2021ctf/OSINT/An%20island%20of%20mascots/C11.jfif)

Reverse searching this image leads me to this webpage [](https://www.city.amami.lg.jp/kikaku/shise/koho/kokutokun.html)

Translating this webpage we can see that Kokuto-kun(the name of the mascot) is the mascot for Amami .

The flag was retrieved.

### Notes:
This challenge could have been much easier without the existence of Kumamoto.
I really went deep looking into him and the other mascots.
