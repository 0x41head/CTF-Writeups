# Introduction

Hi there, I don't know how you found this webpage but welcome anyways.

This place is supposed to keep a log about my progress in CTFs and act as a place where I can dump all my write-ups.

This place is essentialy supposed to be for me so that I don't have to search the web everytime I find a CTF challenge that is simlar to one I have already solved.

As I have only recently started participating seriously in CTFs there might not be much to look at here. But stil feel free to look arounnd.
