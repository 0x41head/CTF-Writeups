## Solution:

I took the same approach with this question as I did with both [readFlag1](https://github.com/0x41head/PBJar-CTF-2021-Write-up/blob/main/misc/readFlag1.md) and
[readFlag2](https://github.com/0x41head/PBJar-CTF-2021-Write-up/blob/main/misc/readFlag2.md) and went straight to 
https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xe2a9e67bdA26Dd48c8312ea1FE6a7C111e5D7a7A#code.

After looking around a bit I found the flag.
