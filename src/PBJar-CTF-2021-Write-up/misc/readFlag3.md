## Solution:

I took the same approach with this question as I did with both [readFlag1](https://0x41head.github.io/CTF-Writeups/book/PBJar-CTF-2021-Write-up/misc/readFlag1.html) and
[readFlag2](https://0x41head.github.io/CTF-Writeups/book/PBJar-CTF-2021-Write-up/misc/readFlag2.html) and went straight to
https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xe2a9e67bdA26Dd48c8312ea1FE6a7C111e5D7a7A#code.

After looking around a bit I found the flag.
