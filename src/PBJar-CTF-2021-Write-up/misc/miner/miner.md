# Problem Statement:
 ![miner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53595853/133964247-9496dbbc-44be-4540-be11-599dbbf322ab.png)
## Solution:
This was an easy one as all I had to do was find the miner on the blockchain.

https://etherscan.io/block/11834380 tells me its `0xd224ca0c819e8e97ba0136b3b95ceff503b79f53`

So, the flag became `flag{0xd224ca0c819e8e97ba0136b3b95ceff503b79f53}`
