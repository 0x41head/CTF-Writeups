# Problem Statement:
 ![miner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x41head/CTF-Writeups/main/src/PBJar-CTF-2021-Write-up/misc/miner/ques.png)
## Solution:
This was an easy one as all I had to do was find the miner on the blockchain.

https://etherscan.io/block/11834380 tells me its `0xd224ca0c819e8e97ba0136b3b95ceff503b79f53`

So, the flag became `flag{0xd224ca0c819e8e97ba0136b3b95ceff503b79f53}`
