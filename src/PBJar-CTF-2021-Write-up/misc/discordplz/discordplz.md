# Problem Statement:
![discord plz](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x41head/CTF-Writeups/main/src/PBJar-CTF-2021-Write-up/misc/discordplz/ques.png)

## Solution:
In order to retrive this flag I joined their discord.

I tried searching for it on discord and ended up finding a user:

![disc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x41head/CTF-Writeups/main/src/PBJar-CTF-2021-Write-up/misc/discordplz/redundant_search.png)

Sadly, that wasn't the flag.

After rummaging through the channels for a solid 10 minutes, I finally found it.

![discflag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x41head/CTF-Writeups/main/src/PBJar-CTF-2021-Write-up/misc/discordplz/flag.png)

That was **very** cheeky.
