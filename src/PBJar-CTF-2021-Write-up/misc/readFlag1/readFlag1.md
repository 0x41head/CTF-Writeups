# Problem Statement:
![readflag1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x41head/CTF-Writeups/main/src/PBJar-CTF-2021-Write-up/misc/readFlag1/ques.png)
## Solution:

I had to look into the code of the smart contract to retrive this flag.

The challege statement told me that the contract was on the Ropsten network, so I make my way to https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xf0674CD7D1C0c616063a786E7d1434340E09BadD 

One look at the contract source code told me what the flag was.
