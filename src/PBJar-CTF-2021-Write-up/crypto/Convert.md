![convert](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53595853/133960501-5f7603ff-9a0f-48f3-8c77-d4e502c1c58a.png)

## Solution:
This challenge tells you what to do in the question itself.
`convert.zip` had a `file.txt` in it, which had the following text: `666c61677b6469735f69735f615f666c346767675f68317d`


The question tells us this is a hexadecimal.


Converting it to text I got the flag: 
`flag{dis_is_a_fl4ggg_h1}`
